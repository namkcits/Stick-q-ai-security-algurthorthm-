# Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) Application

## Overview

Welcome to our Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) application! This groundbreaking technology enables secure communication between two parties, Alice and Bob, over an insecure channel. By leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics and the BB84 protocol, we ensure unparalleled data protection.

## How It Works

1. **Quantum Entanglement**: Alice generates a series of special quantum bits called "qubits" that are entangled. This means they remain correlated even when separated, forming the foundation for secure communication.

2. **Quantum Data Encoding**: Alice encodes her binary data into the qubits using quantum operations. This ensures that the data is quantum-secure and protected from potential attacks.

3. **BB84 Protocol Execution**: Both Alice and Bob independently choose random basis settings and assign random bit values (0 or 1) to the qubits. Alice sends these prepared qubits to Bob through an insecure channel.

4. **Quantum Eavesdropping Detection**: During verification, Alice and Bob compare their chosen basis settings. Any inconsistency reveals the presence of an eavesdropper. This ensures data integrity and immediate detection of unauthorized access.

5. **Error Correction**: Our application implements advanced error-correction techniques to rectify any errors that might occur during quantum communication. This guarantees flawless data exchange.

6. **Generation of Classical Secure Key**: After successful verification, Alice and Bob establish a shared classical secure key consisting of random 0s and 1s. This key serves as the basis for encrypting and decrypting data securely.

## How to Use

1. **Requirements**: To run our QKD application, you'll need Python, Kivy, and Qiskit. Install the necessary packages using `pip`:

   ```
   pip install kivy qiskit
   ```

2. **Running the Application**: Execute the `QuantumApp.py` file to launch our Kivy app. Click the "Generate Quantum Name" button to start the QKD process. Replace the dummy values for the owner's name and token value with your actual data.

3. **Data Storage**: The classical secure key will be securely saved in a file named `<OwnerName>_secure_data.json` for later use.
